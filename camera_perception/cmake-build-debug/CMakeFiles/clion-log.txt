-- Could not find the required component 'util'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "util" with any of
  the following names:

    utilConfig.cmake
    util-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "util" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "util_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "util"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
